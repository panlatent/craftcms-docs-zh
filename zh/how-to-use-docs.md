How to Use the Documentation
============================

We created this documentation to accurately record the functionality of Craft with the purpose of helping you understand how to use it to build websites. This documentation is for _you_.

To get the most of the documentation, we offer the following recommendations:

* If you're new to Craft, be sure that you have a [properly working installation of Craft 3](installation.md) before moving forward.
* A great place to start for an overview of building websites with Craft is the [Pieces of Craft](pieces-of-craft.md) section followed by the [Planning Your Craft Site](planning-your-craft-site.md) section. There you will gain a general understanding of how Craft works, which will aid you in building your site with Craft.
* Most sections of the documentation have detailed examples of how to use the concept we're covering. They are there to help contextualize the Craft feature and make it easier for you to understand how to implement it on your own site.
