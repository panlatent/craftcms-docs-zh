Entries Fields
==============

Entries fields allow you to relate [entries](sections-and-entries.md) to the parent element.

## Settings

Entries fields have the following settings:

* **Sources** – The sections you want to relate entries from. (Default is “All”.)
* **Target Locale** – Which locale entries should be related with (this setting only appears if you’re running Craft Pro with more than one site locale)
* **Limit** – The maximum number of entries that can be related with the field at once. (Default is no limit.)
* **Selection Label** – The label that should be used on the field’s selection button.


## The Field

Entries fields list all of the currently selected entries, with a button to select new ones:

Clicking the “Add an entry” button will bring up a modal window where you can find and select additional entries:

### Editing Entry Content

Double-clicking on a selected entry will open a modal where you can edit the entry’s title and custom fields.

## Templating

If you have an element with an Entries field in your template, you can access its selected entries using your Entries field’s handle:

```twig
{% set entries = entry.entriesFieldHandle %}
```

That will give you an [element query](element-queries.md), prepped to output all of the selected entries for the given field. In other words, the line above is really just a shortcut for this:

```twig
{% set entries = craft.entries({
    relatedTo: { sourceElement: entry, field: "entriesFieldHandle" },
    order:     "sortOrder",
    limit:     null
}) %}
```

(See [Relations](relations.md) for more info on the `relatedTo` param.)

### Examples

To check if your Entries field has any selected entries, you can use the `length` filter:

```twig
{% if entry.entriesFieldHandle|length %}
    ...
{% endif %}
```

To loop through the selected entries, you can treat the field like an array:

```twig
{% for entry in entry.entriesFieldHandle %}
    ...
{% endfor %}
```

Rather than typing “`entry.entriesFieldHandle`” every time, you can call it once and set it to another variable:

```twig
{% set entries = entry.entriesFieldHandle %}

{% if entries|length %}

    <h3>Some great entries</h3>
    {% for entry in entries %}
        ...
    {% endfor %}

{% endif %}
```

You can add parameters to the ElementCriteriaModel object as well:

```twig
{% set newsEntries = entry.entriesFieldHandle.section('news') %}
```

If your Entries field is only meant to have a single entry selected, remember that calling your Entries field will still give you the same ElementCriteriaModel, not the selected entry. To get the first (and only) entry selected, use `first()`:

```twig
{% set entry = entry.myEntriesField.first() %}

{% if entry %}
    ...
{% endif %}
```
